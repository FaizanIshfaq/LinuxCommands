# LinuxCommands
This repository contains multiple linux commands

# Git init:
This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It sets up the necessary files and directories for version control.

# Git clone: 
This command clones an existing Git repository. It creates a local copy of the repository on your computer, allowing you to work with the files and make changes. The repository can be specified using a URL.

# Git add:
This command adds one or more files to the staging area. The staging area is a temporary holding place for changes that you want to include in the next commit. The git add command prepares the changes for commit.

# Git commit: 
This command saves changes to the repository. The git commit command takes the changes from the staging area and permanently records them in the repository. You can add a message to describe the changes you made.

# Git status: 
This command displays the status of the repository. It shows the files that have been modified and are ready to be committed, as well as the files that are still in the working directory and haven't been staged yet.
# Git log: 
This command displays the commit history of the repository. It shows a list of all the commits, including the author, date, and commit message.

# Git diff: 
 This command displays the differences between two versions of a file. You can compare the current version of a file with the version in the repository, or compare two different commits.
# Git reset:
This command un-stages changes. The git reset command removes changes from the staging area and returns them to the working directory.

# Git branch:
This command manages branches in the repository. A branch is a separate line of development within the repository. The git branch command can be used to create new branches, list existing branches, and switch between branches.

# Git checkout:
This command switches between branches or restores files. The git checkout command allows you to switch to a different branch, or restore a file to a previous version.

# Git merge:
This command merges changes from one branch into another. The git merge command takes the changes from one branch and integrates them into another branch. This is used to combine the changes made in separate branches into a single branch.
# Git push:
This command pushes changes to a remote repository. The git push command uploads the changes you have made to a remote repository, allowing others to access them.
# Git pull: 
This command pulls changes from a remote repository. The git pull command downloads the changes made by others in a remote repository and integrates them into your local copy of the repository.
# Git stash: 
This command saves changes temporarily without committing. The git stash command allows you to save changes that you're not yet ready to commit, so you can switch to a different branch or work on something else.

# Git tag: 
This command tags a specific commit in the repository. A tag is a label that you can attach to a specific commit, allowing you to easily identify and reference that commit in the future.
